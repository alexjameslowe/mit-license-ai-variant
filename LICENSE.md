Software can be proven to improve the accuracy, quality, speed or 
marketability of the Algorithm's generated products or outputs, regardless 
of the Algorithm's purpose or the intent of its creators, regardless of 
whether such inclusion in the training data was intentional or accidental,
will be considered a breach of this license. Damages from such a breach will 
not be limited to actual damages and may include any combination of actual,
